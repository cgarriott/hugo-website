description: "How Bank of Canada policy statements move markets."
summary: "Bank of Canada policy statements move markets in two distinct ways: through the surprise in the policy rate itself (the “level” component) and through the surprise in the tone about the future path of rates (the “slope” component)."

##### Abstract

The tone of Canadian monetary policy statements has an impact on the Canadian dollar and long-term Government of Canada bonds. In our sample period from 2006 to 2016, we measure their response in the 60 minutes following these announcements. We find that an unanticipated change in the tone of statements can affect the dollar by as much as 0.5 of a cent. This is a sizable impact considering that an unexpected rate hike (or cut) of 25 basis points (bps) can initially affect the dollar by an average of 1.25 cents. The tone can also initially move the 10-year Government of Canada bond by 2 bps, which again is considerable given that an unexpected rate hike (or cut) can move it by 7 bps.
