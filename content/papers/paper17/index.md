description: "A speculation on how ETFs might change bond-market broker-dealing."
summary: "Bond ETFs are could turn into balance‑sheet infrastructure for bond markets. Dealers could warehouse large, tradable portfolios of bonds at ETFs, giving them an additional way to lay off risk and source inventory. This would add new layers of intermediation that could reshape how stress propagates through the system."

##### Abstract

This note examines how bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could reshape the mechanics of bond dealing in Canada by inserting ETF managers and authorized participants into the traditional dealer‑to‑dealer intermediation chain. It describes how ETF “warehousing” of bonds—holding large, tradeable inventories financed by ETF shares—can substitute for some dealer balance‑sheet capacity, potentially supporting liquidity in stressed markets but also adding new layers of operational and funding complexity. The authors argue that ETFs are unlikely to fully replace dealers’ market‑making role but will increasingly influence pricing, risk‑sharing, and the organisation of bond intermediation, warranting close monitoring by regulators and central banks.
