summary: "NYSE’s Retail Liquidity Program segmented its retail flow from the main venue. This is a theoretical worry but, for NYSE, a modest win. The program separated retail trades into a special dark segment makes prices easier to read and trading slightly cheaper for everyone."

##### Abstract

In August 2012, the New York Stock Exchange launched the Retail Liquidity Program
(RLP), a trading facility that enables participating organizations to quote dark limit orders
executable only by retail traders. A Hasbrouck (1991) structural vector autoregression
shows that the facility increased the information content of the order flow by
distinguishing retail trades from relatively more informed trades. A differences-in-
differences event study finds that the RLP launch impacted market quality. Stocks with
substantial RLP activity experienced mildly improved relative bid-ask spreads, effective
spreads, price impacts and return autocorrelations in both the RLP and non-RLP
segments.
