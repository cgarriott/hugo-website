description: "This paper estimates the benefits to liquidity of competition among high-frequency traders. Published in the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 2018." 
summary: "High-frequency traders on Canada’s Alpha exchange end up looking more like Cournot quantity competitors than razor‑thin price undercutters. Their rivalry makes markets smoother and cheaper for everyone else, as expected in Cournot competition."

##### Abstract

Theory on high-frequency traders (HFTs) predicts that market liquidity for a security decreases in the number of HFTs trading the security. We test this prediction by studying a new Canadian stock exchange, Alpha, that experienced the entry of 11 HFTs over 4 years. We find that bid–ask spreads on Alpha converge to those at the Toronto Stock Exchange as more HFTs trade on Alpha. Effective and realized spreads for non-HFTs improve as HFTs enter the market. To explain the contrast with theory, which models the HFT as a price competitor, we provide evidence more consistent with HFTs fitting a quantity-competitor framework.
